    "1. What exactly is []?\n",
    "Ans - list\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In a list of values stored in a variable called spam, how would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value? (Assume [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] are in spam.)\n",

    "9. What are the list concatenation and list replication operators?\n",
    "Ans - \n",
    "a. concatination - The '+' operator is used to concatenate (combine) two or more lists into a single list.\n",
    " ex - \n",
    "    l1 = [1,2,3,\"elon\"]\n",
    "    l2 = ['musk','is','obsessed','with','his past ', 'X']\n",
    "    l3 = l1 + l2\n",
    "    l3\n",
    "    \n",
    "b. replication - The * operator is used to replicate the all elements present inside a list .\n",
    " ex - \n",
    " l2 = [\"am\", \"i\" ,\"preparing\" ,\"for\" ,\"job\"]*2\n",
    " l2\n",
    "10. What is difference between the list methods append() and insert()?\n",
    "Ans - append() - inserts objects at the last index\n",
    "      insert() - inserts objects at the specified index as it two arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What are the two methods for removing items from a list?\n",
    "Ans - pop() and remove()\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Describe how list values and string values are identical.\n",
    "Ans - a.they are both sequential data type.\n",
    "      b.they have same method for indexing\n",
    "      c.they have some slicing operations\n",
    "      d.both can be iterated for example we can use for loop to print all the objects present inside list as well as string\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What's the difference between tuples and lists?\n",
    "Ans - a.tuples are immutable and lists are mutable.\n",
    "      b.syntax for tuple - ()\n",
    "        syntax for list - []\n",
    "      c.the performace of tuple is better since it is immutable thus python can optimize memory usage for tuple.\n",
    "      d.gerally lists are used for storing objects where objects can inserted if needed in future or also they deleted on the \n",
    "        other hand tuple are used to store objects so that the data remains secure and no modification of that data is                 required. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "14. How do you type a tuple value that only contains the integer 42?\n",
    "Ans - t = (42)\n",
    "\n",
    "15. How do you get a list value's tuple form? How do you get a tuple value's list form?\n",
    "Ans - a. tuple(list_variable)\n",
    "      b. list(tuple_variable)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "16. Variables that \"contain\" list values are not necessarily lists themselves. Instead, what do they contain?\n",
    "Ans - not able to understand question.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "17. How do you distinguish between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?\n",
    "Ans - opy.copy(): Creates a shallow copy of the object, retaining references to nested objects and any changes to copyed object will affect the original.\n",
    "copy.deepcopy(): Creates a deep copy of the object, recursively duplicating all nested objects for complete independence.it does not the original object. for this new independent object new memory is allocated.\n",
